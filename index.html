    As part of a collaborative effort, my team and I developed an innovative IoT-based solution, <b>Smart Shoes for the Blind</b>, aimed at enhancing mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals. The shoes are embedded with sensors to detect obstacles and provide real-time feedback through vibrations, ensuring ease of navigation in various environments. This project won <b>1st place</b>in a "Project Expo-2022" conducted by our college, earning us a cash prize of <b>Rs. 10,000</b> for its practical application and potential to improve quality of life for the blind.

    I participated in the prestigious "CodeExtreme" competition, held at KGISL College of Technology, where I secured the 2nd prize. The competition involved solving complex coding problems under time constraints, testing my programming, problem-solving skills, and ability to think critically under pressure.

    The event presented us with a series of challenging real-world problems, requiring innovative and efficient coding solutions. Collaborating with my team, I utilized various programming techniques to address these challenges, enhancing my expertise in algorithms and data structures. This experience honed my technical proficiency, while also reinforcing my teamwork and time management skills.
